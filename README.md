This is a repository for the code that I've wrote for different projects that I've worked on.

1) cancer_diagnostic_app: This is the backend for an app that I worked on in the Machine Learning Research Group at Boston University. Its goal is to help researchers implement machine learning techniques to help classify their data. We tested this pipeline using cancer RNA-sequencing data as well as whole slide image data.

2) Rshiny: This is an Rshiny application that I made for my R class at Boston university that allows a user to perform differential expression on a raw counts matrix, with several customizations to the process possible.

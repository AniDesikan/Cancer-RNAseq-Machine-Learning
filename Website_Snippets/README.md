# Website Snippets

These are some website snippets from HoTResDB, the website/SQL database that my group built / is building for Dr. Connor's lab at Boston University. 

These specific snippets detail a front end form to enter data into so that the user can put data into the database, while the python file is the backend code that connects to the SQL database and actually enters the sanitized data.

# Snakemake Pipelines

These are various pipelines for NGS sequencing that I've made in snakemake. The ones uploaded here are for ATAC seq, to detect open chromatin regions, and CHIP seq, specifically to understand transcription factor binding.

These pipelines have figures that are output at the end to help the user understand what kind of inputs were made.

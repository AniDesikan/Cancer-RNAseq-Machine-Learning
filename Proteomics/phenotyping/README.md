This is a folder displaying all the work that I've done on reproducing the Matlab code from the paper "Single-cell spatial landscapes of the lung tumour immune microenvironment" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9931585/), which uses Imaging Mass Cytometry analysis in order to draw conclusion on Lung adenocarcinoma. I have decided to recreate the entire thing in Python, so that it can be easily integrated into a Django app, and people can easily conduct these analysis when more data is made in the future.

Currently all of the code for taking an image with segmented cells and phenotyping them using flow cytometry data is complete. 

This is a work in progress.
